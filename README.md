# Site Encrypter
Site Encrypter is a PHP Class that allows you to encrypt all files on a site.<br>
It could be useful, for example, to a young developer as a prevention in the event that the customer who requested the development of a site on one of his hosts blocks ftp access at the end of development and does not intend to pay.

## Getting Started
Upload the encrypt.php file on the server, the file can be placed anywhere within the site folders and can be renamed with any name in order to hide it among the other files.
